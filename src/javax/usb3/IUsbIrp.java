/**
 * Interface for a USB I/O Request Packet (IRP).
 * <p>
 * A software client normally requests data transfers via I/O Request Packets
 * (IRPs) to a pipe and then either waits or is notified when they are
 * completed. Details about IRPs are defined in an operating system- specific
 * manner.
 * <p>
 * A UsbIrp has methods that can be divided into four different categories; the
 * data buffer, status, short packets, and the UsbException.
 * <p>
 * An IRP may require multiple data payloads to move the client data over the
 * bus. The data payloads for such a multiple data payload IRP are expected to
 * be of the maximum packet size until the last data payload that contains the
 * remainder of the overall IRP.
 * <p>
 * Some USB communication requires additional metadata that describes how the
 * actual data should be handled when being transferred. This IUsbIrp
 * encapsulates the actual data buffer, as well as other metadata that gives the
 * user more control and knowledge over how the data is handled.
 * <p>
 * Before submitting this, at least some of these (depending on IUsbIrp
 * implementation) must be performed:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link #getData() data} must be {@link #setData(byte[]) set}.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #getOffset() data offset}, may be
 * {@link #setOffset(int) set}.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #getLength() data length} may be
 * {@link #setLength(int) set}.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #getAcceptShortPacket() Short Packet policy} may be
 * {@link #setAcceptShortPacket(boolean) set}.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #getUsbException() UsbException} must be null (and
 * {@link #isUsbException() isUsbException} must be false).</li>
 * <li>The {@link #isComplete() complete state} must be false.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Any IUsbIrp implementation must behave as specified in this interface's
 * documentation, including the specified defaults. Note that
 * {@link #setData(byte[]) setData} also sets the offset to 0 and the length to
 * data.length; if other values should be used, use the
 * {@link #setData(byte[],int,int) 3-parameter setData} or set the
 * {@link #setOffset(int) offset} and {@link #setLength(int) length} with their
 * setters <i>after</i> setting the data.
 * <p>
 * The javax.usb implementation will set the
 * {@link #getActualLength() data length} or, if unsuccessful, the
 * {@link #getUsbException() UsbException}, after processing. Finally, it will
 * call {@link #complete() complete}.
 * <p>
 * See the USB 1.1 specification section 5.3.2 for details on USB IRPs. The IRP
 * defined in this API has more than is mentioned in the USB 1.1 specification.
