/**
 * Interface for a USB interface descriptor.
 * <p>
 * The interface descriptor describes a specific interface within a
 * configuration. A configuration provides one or more interfaces, each with
 * zero or more endpoint descriptors describing a unique set of endpoints within
 * the configuration. When a configuration supports more than one interface, the
 * endpoint descriptors for a particular interface follow the interface
 * descriptor in the data returned by the GetConfiguration() request. An
 * interface descriptor is always returned as part of a configuration
 * descriptor. Interface descriptors cannot be directly accessed with a
 * GetDescriptor() or SetDescriptor() request.
 * <p>
 * An interface may include alternate settings that allow the endpoints and/or
 * their characteristics to be varied after the device has been configured. The
 * default setting for an interface is always alternate setting zero. The
 * SetInterface() request is used to select an alternate setting or to return to
 * the default setting. The GetInterface() request returns the selected
 * alternate setting.
 * <p>
 * Alternate settings allow a portion of the device configuration to be varied
 * while other interfaces remain in operation. If a configuration has alternate
 * settings for one or more of its interfaces, a separate interface descriptor
 * and its associated endpoints are included for each setting.
 * <p>
 * If a device configuration supported a single interface with two alternate
 * settings, the configuration descriptor would be followed by an interface
 * descriptor with the bInterfaceNumber and bAlternateSetting fields set to zero
 * and then the endpoint descriptors for that setting, followed by another
 * interface descriptor and its associated endpoint descriptors. The second
 * interface descriptorâ€™s bInterfaceNumber field would also be set to zero, but
 * the bAlternateSetting field of the second interface descriptor would be set
 * to one.
 * <p>
 * If an interface uses only endpoint zero, no endpoint descriptors follow the
 * interface descriptor. In this case, the bNumEndpoints field must be set to
 * zero. An interface descriptor never includes endpoint zero in the number of
 * endpoints.
 * <p>
 * See the USB 1.1 specification section 9.6.3.
