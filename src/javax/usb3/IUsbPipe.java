/**
 * Interface for a USB pipe.
 * <p>
 * See the USB 1.1 specification sec 5.3.2 for details on USB pipes. Data flows
 * in the {@link javax.usb.UsbEndpoint#getDirection() direction} defined by the
 * associated {@link #getUsbEndpoint() endpoint}, except for Control
 * {@link javax.usb.UsbEndpoint#getType() type} pipes.
 * <p>
 * This pipe's configuration and interface setting must be active to use this
 * pipe. Any attempt to use a IUsbPipe belonging to an inactive configuration or
 * interface setting will throw a UsbNotActiveException.
 * <p>
 * A USB pipe is an association between an endpoint on a device and software on
 * the host. Pipes represent the ability to move data between software on the
 * host via a memory buffer and an endpoint on a device. There are two mutually
 * exclusive pipe communication modes: <ul>
 * <li> Stream: Data moving through a pipe has no USB-defined structure </li>
 * <li> Message: Data moving through a pipe has some USB-defined structure
 * </li></ul>
 * The USB does not interpret the content of data it delivers through a pipe.
 * Even though a message pipe requires that data be structured according to USB
 * definitions, the content of the data is not interpreted by the USB.
 * <p>
 * The pipe that consists of the two endpoints with endpoint number zero is
 * called the Default Control Pipe. This pipe is always available once a device
 * is powered and has received a bus reset. Other pipes come into existence when
 * a USB device is configured. The Default Control Pipe is used by the USB
 * System Software to determine device identification and configuration
 * requirements and to configure the device. The Default Control Pipe can also
 * be used by device-specific software after the device is configured.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, pipes have the following associated with them: <ul>
 * <li> A claim on USB bus access and bandwidth usage.</li>
 * <li> A transfer type.</li>
 * <li> The associated endpoint’s characteristics, such as directionality and
 * maximum data payload sizes. The data payload is the data that is carried in
 * the data field of a data packet within a bus transaction (as defined in
 * Chapter 8).</li></ul>
 * A software client normally requests data transfers via I/O Request Packets
 * (IRPs) to a pipe and then either waits or is notified when they are
 * completed. Details about IRPs are defined in an operating system- specific
 * manner.
 * <p>
 * USB bandwidth is allocated among pipes. The USB allocates bandwidth for some
 * pipes when a pipe is established. USB devices are required to provide some
 * buffering of data. It is assumed that USB devices requiring more bandwidth
 * are capable of providing larger buffers. The goal for the USB architecture is
 * to ensure that buffering-induced hardware delay is bounded to within a few
 * milliseconds. The USB’s bandwidth capacity can be allocated among many
 * different data streams. This allows a wide range of devices to be attached to
 * the USB. Further, different device bit rates, with a wide dynamic range, can
 * be concurrently supported. The USB Specification defines the rules for how
 * each transfer type is allowed access to the bus.
 * <p>
 * <strong>USB 3.1: </strong>
 * An Enhanced SuperSpeed pipe is an association between an endpoint on a device
 * and software on the host. Pipes represent the ability to move data between
 * software on the host via a memory buffer and an endpoint on a device and have
 * the same behavior as defined in the Universal Serial Bus Specification,
 * Revision 2.0. The main difference is that when a non-isochronous Enhanced
 * SuperSpeed endpoint is busy it returns a Not Ready (NRDY) response and must
 * send an Endpoint Ready (ERDY) notification when it wants to be serviced
 * again. The host will then reschedule the transaction at the next available
 * opportunity within the constraints of the transfer type.
