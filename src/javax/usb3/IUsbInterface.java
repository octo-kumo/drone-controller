/**
 * Interface for a USB interface.
 * <p>
 * This object actually represents a specific 'alternate' setting for a USB
 * interface. Interfaces must have at least one alternate setting, and one and
 * only one setting is active per interface. All settings share the same
 * interface number.
 * <p>
 * If this interface setting is not active, it cannot be claimed or released;
 * the active interface setting should be used for claiming and releasing
 * ownership of the interface; also no action may be taken on any parts of this
 * interface setting, if the setting is not active. Any attempt to perform
 * action on objects belonging to an inactive interface setting will throw a
 * UsbNotActiveException.
 * <p>
 * The interface descriptor describes a specific interface within a
 * configuration. A configuration provides one or more interfaces, each with
 * zero or more endpoint descriptors describing a unique set of endpoints within
 * the configuration. When a configuration supports more than one interface, the
 * endpoint descriptors for a particular interface follow the interface
 * descriptor in the data returned by the GetConfiguration() request. An
 * interface descriptor is always returned as part of a configuration
 * descriptor. Interface descriptors cannot be directly accessed with a
 * GetDescriptor() or SetDescriptor() request.
 * <p>
 * An interface may include alternate settings that allow the endpoints and/or
 * their characteristics to be varied after the device has been configured. The
 * default setting for an interface is always alternate setting zero. The
 * SetInterface() request is used to select an alternate setting or to return to
 * the default setting. The GetInterface() request returns the selected
 * alternate setting.
 * <p>
 * Alternate settings allow a portion of the device configuration to be varied
 * while other interfaces remain in operation. If a configuration has alternate
 * settings for one or more of its interfaces, a separate interface descriptor
 * and its associated endpoints are included for each setting.
 * <p>
 * If a device configuration supported a single interface with two alternate
 * settings, the configuration descriptor would be followed by an interface
 * descriptor with the bInterfaceNumber and bAlternateSetting fields set to zero
 * and then the endpoint descriptors for that setting, followed by another
 * interface descriptor and its associated endpoint descriptors. The second
 * interface descriptorâ€™s bInterfaceNumber field would also be set to zero, but
 * the bAlternateSetting field of the second interface descriptor would be set
 * to one. If an interface uses only endpoint zero, no endpoint descriptors
 * follow the interface descriptor. In this case, the bNumEndpoints field must
 * be set to zero. An interface descriptor never includes endpoint zero in the
 * number of endpoints. Table 9-12 shows the
 * <p>
 * See USB 2.0 sec 9.6.5 Interface
