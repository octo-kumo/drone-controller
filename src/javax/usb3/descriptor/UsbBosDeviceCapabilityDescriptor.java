/**
 * 9.6.2 Binary Device Object Store (BOS) Device Descriptor Definition.

 * Device Capability descriptors are always returned as part of the BOS
 * information returned by a GetDescriptor(BOS) request. A Device Capability
 * cannot be directly accessed with a GetDescriptor() or SetDescriptor()
 * request.
 * <p>
 * It is advised to check bDevCapabilityType and call the matching
 * get*Descriptor method to get a structure fully matching the type.
 * <p>
 * Individual technology-specific or generic device-level capabilities are
 * reported via Device Capability descriptors. The format of the Device
 * Capability descriptor is defined in Table 9-13.
 * <p>
 * See Table 9-13. Format of a Device Capability Descriptor of the USB 3.1 spec.
