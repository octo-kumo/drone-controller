/**
 * 9.6.2 Binary Device Object Store (BOS) Descriptor Definition.
 * <p>
 * The BOS descriptor defines a root descriptor that is similar to the
 * configuration descriptor, and is the base descriptor for accessing a family
 * of related descriptors. A host can read a BOS descriptor and learn from the
 * wTotalLength field the entire size of the device-level descriptor set, or it
 * can read in the entire BOS descriptor set of device capabilities.
 * <p>
 * The host accesses this descriptor using the GetDescriptor() request. The
 * descriptor type in the GetDescriptor() request is set to BOS (see Table
 * 9-12). There is no way for a host to read individual device capability
 * descriptors. The entire set can only be accessed via reading the BOS
 * descriptor with a GetDescriptor() request and using the length reported in
 * the wTotalLength field.
