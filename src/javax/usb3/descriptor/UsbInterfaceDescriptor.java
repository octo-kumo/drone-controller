/**
 * 9.6.5 Interface Descriptor implementation.
 * <p>
 * Devices report their attributes using descriptors. A descriptor is a data
 * structure with a defined format.
 * <p>
 * The interface descriptor describes a specific interface within a
 * configuration. A configuration provides one or more interfaces, each with
 * zero or more endpoint descriptors describing a unique set of endpoints within
 * the configuration. When a configuration supports more than one interface, the
 * endpoint descriptors for a particular interface follow the interface
 * descriptor in the data returned by the GetConfiguration() request. An
 * interface descriptor is always returned as part of a configuration
 * descriptor. Interface descriptors cannot be directly accessed with a
 * GetDescriptor() or SetDescriptor() request.
 * <p>
 * An interface may include alternate settings that allow the endpoints and/or
 * their characteristics to be varied after the device has been configured. The
 * default setting for an interface is always alternate setting zero. Alternate
 * settings allow a portion of the device configuration to be varied while other
 * interfaces remain in operation. If a configuration has alternate settings for
 * one or more of its interfaces, a separate interface descriptor and its
 * associated endpoint and endpoint companion (when reporting its Enhanced
 * SuperSpeed configuration) descriptors are included for each setting.
 * <p>
 * If a device configuration supported a single interface with two alternate
 * settings, the configuration descriptor would be followed by an interface
 * descriptor with the bInterfaceNumber and bAlternateSetting fields set to zero
 * and then the endpoint and endpoint companion (when reporting its Enhanced
 * SuperSpeed configuration) descriptors for that setting, followed by another
 * interface descriptor and its associated endpoint and endpoint companion
 * descriptors. The second interface descriptorâ€™s bInterfaceNumber field would
 * also be set to zero, but the bAlternateSetting field of the second interface
 * descriptor would be set to one.
 * <p>
 * If an interface uses only the Default Control Pipe, no endpoint descriptors
 * follow the interface descriptor. In this case, the bNumEndpoints field shall
 * be set to zero.
 * <p>
 * An interface descriptor never includes the Default Control Pipe in the number
 * of endpoints.
