/**
 * An enumerated list of standard Feature Selectors available when using the
 * CLEAR_FEATURE, SET_FEATURE standard device requests.
 * <p>
 * Feature selectors are used when enabling or setting features, such as remote
 * wakeup, specific to a device, interface, or endpoint.
 * <p>
 * If an unsupported or invalid request is made to a USB device, the device
 * responds by returning STALL in the Data or Status stage of the request. If
 * the device detects the error in the Setup stage, it is preferred that the
 * device returns STALL at the earlier of the Data or Status stage. Receipt of
 * an unsupported or invalid request does NOT cause the optional Halt feature on
 * the control pipe to be set. If for any reason, the device becomes unable to
 * communicate via its Default Control Pipe due to an error condition, the
 * device must be reset to clear the condition and restart the Default Control
 * Pipe.
