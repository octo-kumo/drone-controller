/**
 * Enumerated list of Standard Device Requests.
 * <p>
 * See Table 9-3 of USB 2.0 and Table 9.4 of USB 3.1.
 * <p>
 * The USB Specification defines a series of standard requests that all devices
 * must support. In addition, a device class may define additional requests. A
 * device vendor may also define requests supported by the device. USB devices
 * must respond to standard device requests, even if the device has not yet been
 * assigned an address or has not been configured.
 * <p>
 * This helper class simplifies accessing the {@code bRequest} field in
 * control-type USB IRP (I/O Request Packet).
 * <p>
 * The {@code bRequest} field specifies the particular request. The Type bits in
 * the bmRequestType field modify the meaning of this field. The USB
 * specification defines values for the bRequest field only when the bits are
 * reset to zero, indicating a standard request

   * The Recipient bits of the bmRequestType field specify the desired
   * recipient. The data returned is the current status of the specified
   * recipient.

   * If wValue or wLength are not as specified as follows or if wIndex is

   * <li>Data : Device, Interface, or Endpoint Status </li></ul>
   * <p>
   * If an interface or an endpoint is specified that does not exist, then the
   * device responds with a Request Error. A GetStatus() request to a device
   * returns bit-coded information as follows: D0 = Self Powered, D1 = Remote
   * Wakeup, D2 ... D15 Reserved (Reset to zero).
   * <p>
   * The Self Powered field indicates whether the device is currently
   * self-powered. If D0 is reset to zero, the device is bus-powered. If D0 is
   * set to one, the device is self-powered. The Self Powered field may not be
   * changed by the SetFeature() or ClearFeature() requests.
   * <p>
   * The Remote Wakeup field indicates whether the device is currently enabled
   * to request remote wakeup. The default mode for devices that support remote
   * wakeup is disabled. The Remote Wakeup field can be modified by the
   * SetFeature() and ClearFeature() requests using the DEVICE_REMOTE_WAKEUP
   * feature selector. This field is reset to zero when the device is reset.
   * <p>
   * A GetStatus() request to an interface returns ALL ZEROES.
   * <p>
   * A GetStatus() request to an endpoint returns bit-coded information as
   * follows: D0: Halt, D1 ... D15: Reserved (Reset to zero). The Halt feature
   * is required to be implemented for all interrupt and bulk endpoint types.
   * When set by the SetFeature() request, the endpoint exhibits the same stall
   * behavior as if the field had been set by a hardware condition.

   * index is from 0 to one less than the number of descriptors of that type

   * descriptor, all interface descriptors, and endpoint descriptors for all of
