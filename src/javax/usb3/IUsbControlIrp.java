 * Interface for a control-type USB IRP (I/O Request Packet).
 * <p>
 * This is identical to a IUsbIrp, except this also contains the
 * Control-specific setup packet information.
 * <p>
 * Each USB device is required to implement the Default Control Pipe as a
 * message pipe. This pipe is used by the USB System Software. The Default
 * Control Pipe provides access to the USB device’s configuration, status, and
 * control information. A function can, but is not required to, provide
 * endpoints for additional control pipes for its own implementation needs.
 * <p>
 * The USB device framework defines standard, device class, or vendor-specific
 * requests that can be used to manipulate a device’s state. Descriptors are
 * also defined that can be used to contain different information on the device.
 * Control transfers provide the transport mechanism to access device
 * descriptors and make requests of a device to manipulate its behavior.
