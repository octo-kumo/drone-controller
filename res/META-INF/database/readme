The USB ID Repository

Maintained by Stephen J. Gowdy <linux.usb.ids@gmail.com>

If you have any new entries, please submit them via	http://www.linux-usb.org/usb-ids.html or send entries as patches (diff -u old new) in the	body of your email (a bot will attempt to deal with it). The latest version can be obtained from http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids.

This is a public repository of all known ID's used in USB devices: ID's of vendors, devices, subsystems and device classes. It is used in various programs (e.g., The USB Utilities) to display full human-readable names instead of cryptic numeric codes. 

We generate daily snapshots of the database in form of a usb.ids file. You can download the snapshot to update the list used by your system: 

The contents of the database and the generated files can be distributed under the terms of either the GNU General Public License (version 2 or later) or of the 3-clause BSD License.
